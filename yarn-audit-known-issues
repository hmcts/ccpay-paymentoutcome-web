Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.\n\nBy first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.\n\nAdditionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.

All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc"},"1091344":{"findings":[{"version":"6.0.5","paths":["express-nunjucks>nunjucks-async-loader>chokidar>fsevents>nan>node-gyp>tar","express-nunjucks>nunjucks-async-loader>chokidar>fsevents>nan>node-gyp>make-fetch-happen>cacache>tar"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=6.0.0 <6.1.9","module_name":"tar","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh","cves":["CVE-2021-37713"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=6.1.9","cvss":{"score":8.2,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N"},"updated":"2023-03-13T21:47:38.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 6.1.9 or later","cwe":["CWE-22"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1091344,"references":"- https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh\n- https://www.npmjs.com/package/tar\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-37713\n- https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html\n- https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-389290.pdf\n- https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/52b09e309bcae0c741a7eb79a17ef36e7828b946\n- https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/82eac952f7c10765969ed464e549375854b26edc\n- https://github.com/isaacs/node-tar/commit/875a37e3ec031186fc6599f6807341f56c584598\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5955-9wpr-37jh","created":"2021-08-31T16:05:05.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite on Windows via insufficient relative path sanitization","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\nnode-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted.

If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n#### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:\n\n1. The `String.normalize('NFKD')` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.\n2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, `\\` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).\n3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non-symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq89-hq3f-393p"},"1091725":{"findings":[{"version":"2.88.2","paths":["request","request-promise-native>request","@hmcts/info-provider>request-promise-native>request","@hmcts/info-provider>request-promise-native>request-promise-core>request"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=2.88.2","module_name":"request","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6","cves":["CVE-2023-28155"],"access":"public","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","cvss":{"score":6.1,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N"},"updated":"2023-04-14T20:24:55.000Z","recommendation":"None","cwe":["CWE-918"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1091725,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28155\n- https://github.com/request/request/issues/3442\n- https://github.com/request/request/pull/3444\n- https://doyensec.com/resources/Doyensec_Advisory_RequestSSRF_Q12023.pdf\n- https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230413-0007/\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6","created":"2023-03-16T15:30:19.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Server-Side Request Forgery in Request","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"The Request package through 2.88.2 for Node.js allows a bypass of SSRF mitigations via an attacker-controller server that does a cross-protocol redirect (HTTP to HTTPS, or HTTPS to HTTP).

However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations.\n\n## Impact\nThis vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution.\n\n## Mitigation\nThis vulnerability is patched in json5 v2.2.2 and later. A patch has also been backported for json5 v1 in versions v1.0.2 and later.\n\n## Details\n \nSuppose a developer wants to allow users and admins to perform some risky operation, but they want to restrict what non-admins can do. To accomplish this, they accept a JSON blob from the user, parse it using `JSON5.parse`, confirm that the provided data does not set some sensitive keys, and then performs the risky operation using the validated data:\n \n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5');\n\nconst doSomethingDangerous = (props) => {\n  if (props.isAdmin) {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as admin.');\n  } else {\n    console.log('Doing dangerous thing as user.');\n  }\n};\n\nconst secCheckKeysSet = (obj, searchKeys) => {\n  let searchKeyFound = false;\n  Object.keys(obj).forEach((key) => {\n    if (searchKeys.indexOf(key) > -1) {\n      searchKeyFound = true;\n    }\n  });\n  return searchKeyFound;\n};\n\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\"}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as user.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n```\n \nIf the user attempts to set the `isAdmin` key, their request will be rejected:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"isAdmin\": true}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props);\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...'); // Error: Forbidden...\n}\n```\n \nHowever, users can instead set the `__proto__` key to `{\"isAdmin\": true}`. `JSON5` will parse this key and will set the `isAdmin` key on the prototype of the returned object, allowing the user to bypass the security check and run their request as an admin:\n \n```js\nconst props = JSON5.parse('{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"__proto__\": {\"isAdmin\": true}}');\nif (!secCheckKeysSet(props, ['isAdmin', 'isMod'])) {\n  doSomethingDangerous(props); // \"Doing dangerous thing as admin.\"\n} else {\n  throw new Error('Forbidden...');\n}\n ```","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h"},"1092448":{"findings":[{"version":"3.0.1","paths":["request>tough-cookie","request-promise-native>request>tough-cookie","@hmcts/info-provider>request-promise-native>request>tough-cookie","@hmcts/info-provider>request-promise-native>request-promise-core>request>tough-cookie"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<4.1.3","module_name":"tough-cookie","severity":"moderate","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","cves":["CVE-2023-26136"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.1.3","cvss":{"score":6.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N"},"updated":"2023-07-10T10:37:21.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.1.3 or later","cwe":["CWE-1321"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1092448,"references":"- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26136\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/282\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/commit/12d474791bb856004e858fdb1c47b7608d09cf6e\n- https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/releases/tag/v4.1.3\n- https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TOUGHCOOKIE-5672873\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-72xf-g2v4-qvf3","created":"2023-07-01T06:30:16.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"tough-cookie Prototype Pollution vulnerability","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"Versions of the package tough-cookie before 4.1.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution due to improper handling of Cookies when using CookieJar in `rejectPublicSuffixes=false` mode.
